Appeals against RTA licence decisions

The New South Wales Local Court determines some appeals such as appeals against decisions of the RMS related to drivers licences. These appeals are made by an application to the local court on the relevant form.

Appeals against local court decisions

The local court also determines appeals against its own decisions when a person is convicted and sentenced in their absence. This is called a Section 4 Review or an Application for Annulment.
