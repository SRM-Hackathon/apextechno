<b><i><h2>
A criminal case is a case to decide whether a person who has been charged is guilty of a crime or other offence.

The majority of criminal cases in New South Wales first come before the NSW Local Court. Juries are not used in the local court.

Less serious criminal cases, sometimes called summary cases, are typically dealt with by the NSW Local Court alone. Less serious criminal cases include those where a person has received a penalty or infringement notice or a fine and has chosen to have the matter heard by a court.

Serious criminal cases first come to the local court but may progress to a higher court. This is called a committal.
