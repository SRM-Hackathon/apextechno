Apprehended violence orders (AVOs)

AVOs are orders that a court makes to protect people. AVOs protect people by ordering a person known as the 'defendant' not to assault, molest, harass, intimidate or stalk the protected person for a specific period of time. 

AVOs can also have additional orders. For example, orders can be made which prohibit the defendant from contacting the protected person, going within a certain distance of the protected person's home or work, and destroying or damaging the protected person's property. Read more about AVOs on LawAssist's AVO pages. 

AVOs do not give defendants a criminal record. 

The defendant is not allowed to keep any firearms, or to hold a firearms licence for 10 years after the AVO ends, unless the AVO is cancelled by the court. If you are a defendant and have a firearms licence, or any firearms, you must immediately surrender them to the police. 

An AVO can be registered in another state. If the protected person moves to another Australian state or territory they can register the AVO with a court in that state or territory. The AVO will then continue to provide protection for them. The defendant does not have to be told that the order is registered in another state or territory.
