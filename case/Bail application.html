The police or a court can set conditions as part of a bail agreement. Conditions can include another person, called a surety or acceptable person, agreeing to deposit or forfeit money as a guarantee for bail being complied with.

Conditions can also include requirements to:

regularly report to police

not associate with certain people
When the case is completed, the bail agreement ends and any money paid into court can be refunded.
